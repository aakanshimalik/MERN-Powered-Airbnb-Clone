# Aakanshi‑x‑Stay

Aakanshi‑x‑Stay is a full‑stack MERN application for listing, discovering, and booking stays. It features role‑based access (guest / host), secure authentication, rich booking logic, image uploads, dashboards, and more. The project is designed to showcase depth in functionality, architecture, and scalability.

## 🏠 Project Overview

Aakanshi‑x‑Stay is intended to provide a seamless experience for:

- **Guests** to browse, filter, and book stays

- **Dashboards** for both roles to view bookings, listings, earnings, etc.  

It emphasizes real-world logic: preventing overlapping bookings, validating dates, enforcing permissions, and providing responsive UI across devices.
